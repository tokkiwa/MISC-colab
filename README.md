# MISC-colab
Unofficial Pytorch Implementation of MISC on Google Colaboratory

# Description 
This is an implementation of the paper MISC (Li et al. MISC: Ultra-low Bitrate Image Semantic Compression Driven by Large Multimodal Model, 2024. https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16749 ). 
You can access the notebook via `Open with Colab` button above! 


Here is [Official repository](https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/MISC). 
I modified some parts: I made prompt-generation part (Requires ChatGPT API key), and I rewrote the code so that it works on later version of DiffBIR.
