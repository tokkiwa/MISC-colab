# MISC-colab
Unofficial Pytorch Implementation of MISC on Google Colaboratory

# Description 
This is an implementation of the paper MISC (Li et al. MISC: Ultra-low Bitrate Image Semantic Compression Driven by Large Multimodal Model, 2024. https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16749 ). 
You can access the notebook [HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LvALhLeLnsvJPzloCe1zMP1HzDkawwbg?usp=sharing)


Here is [Official repository](https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/MISC). 
I modified some parts: I made prompt-generation part (Requires ChatGPT API key), and I rewrote the code so that it works on later version of DiffBIR.
